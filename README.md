  ## Installation
  Users can clone this code repo using an IDE of choice. They must ensure inquirer is being imported, and install pg as a postgreSQL package manager. Because this code base uses JavaScript, users must utilize 'npx tsc' to build the app and 'npx nodemon' to run dev. So long as you are in the correct file, the terminal should populate prompt messages regarding employee data that you can respond to.
  ## Usage
  You will clone this repo, install npm as a package manager, confirm you're in the correct file, and run npm start in the terminal for all the prompt messages to appear. You can add your responses directly in the terminal, allowing you to exit at any point. While doing so, you can filter your employee data by selecting various prompts (ie. "View All Departments" will query the DB to only populate department name and id data.) Watch the video below for additional information and a step-by-step guide.

  ## Tests
